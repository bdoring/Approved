# Approved

Approved is an expense management tool that can be used by companies of any size. Its main purpose is to make the process of reviewing, approving and archiving vendor invoices easier.

## About the Project
Approved is my capstone project that I created while attending Galvanize's Full Stack Web Development Immersive (Aug 2017 - Feb 2018). The project was built in less than two weeks using an unfamiliar environment: Vue.js.

## Built With

* Vue.js/Vuex
* Vuetify
* Vue Auth/JSON Web Tokens
* Node.js/Express
* Knex/PostgreSQL
* bCrypt
* AWS S3

## Brief Demo
This demo covers the process of uploading a new vendor invoice. More demos for all of Approved's functionalites are being recorded - stay tuned!
